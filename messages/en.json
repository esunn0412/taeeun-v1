    "description": "I'm a student developer and AI researcher who firmly believes that even the most advanced AI is meaningless without a platform or application that brings it to life for real users. I strive to bridge that gap, leveraging AI to build experiences that has tangible impact on the general public.",
    "education": "I'm currently a rising junior at Emory University, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. As Co-Hackathon Director and Project Lead at <projectLink>Project Emory</projectLink>, I organized <hackathonLink>Emory's first-ever CS Hackathon</hackathonLink> with an amazing team and led a student team to build a website for a local business. Now, as Vice President of Project Emory, I’m focused on building a community of curious, driven, and collaborative students, to support and encourage everyone on their journey.",
    "interests": "In my free time, I enjoy kickboxing, singing and playing guitar, cafe hopping for a good cup of latte, crying to great movies, or eating good food with good people."
